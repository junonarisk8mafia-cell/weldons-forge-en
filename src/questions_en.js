Mixing these up matters: ignoring a 禁止 sign is a rule violation, while 注意 just means proceed carefully. 🇯🇵 TIP: Other critical safety kanji on Japanese sites: 危険 (kiken) = Danger, 必須 (hissu) = Required/Mandatory, 禁煙 (kin-en) = No smoking.

Never look at an arc without proper protection. 🇯🇵 TIP: 電気性眼炎 (arc eye) symptoms appear 6–12 hours AFTER exposure — it is often called '目がやける' (me ga yakeru / eyes burning) on site.

Wet hands or wet ground dramatically increase electrocution risk. 🇯🇵 TIP: Japanese emergency number is 119 (fire/ambulance) — not 911.

Many counterfeit or mislabeled boots slip through unless you actually check the number. 🇯🇵 TIP: Japanese safety boots (安全靴) come with a JIS mark stamped inside. When buying, look specifically for 'JIS T 8101' on the label. Cheap boots from 100-yen-style shops without the correct JIS mark will be rejected at the site entrance — invest in a proper pair from Workman (ワークマン) or Midori Anzen (ミドリ安全)."

MT detects both surface AND near-surface (slightly subsurface) defects on magnetic (carbon steel, ferritic stainless) materials. PT only detects defects OPEN to the surface. MT is more sensitive for magnetic materials — preferred in Japanese shipyards for carbon steel welds. 🇯🇵 TIP: In Japanese shipyards (造船所 / zousenjo), MT is done routinely after each weld pass on hull frames and structural members. The fluorescent wet MT method (蛍光磁粉探傷 / keikoo-jifun-tansho) under UV light is used for maximum sensitivity. If you work in a shipyard and see someone carrying a UV lamp and white spray can, it's MT time — make sure your weld area is accessible and clean."

Remove ANY one of these and the crack cannot form. Solution: preheat + low-hydrogen materials + PWHT. 🇯🇵 TIP: In Japan, welding rods for critical structural work are stored in a rod oven (乾燥炉 / kansou-ro) at 300–350°C before use, and each welder draws only what they need for one session. Leaving rods out on a humid day means they absorb moisture — and that moisture becomes diffusible hydrogen in your weld. Japanese foremen take rod storage very seriously. 'Kan-iro-ni irete okure' (乾燥炉に入れておくれ / please keep them in the drying oven) is a common phrase."

The crack may not form until hours — or even days — after welding. This is why Japanese codes specify post-weld inspection timing: often 24–48 hours after completion for critical welds. 🇯🇵 TIP: On Japanese construction sites, the quality plan (品質計画書 / hinshitsu-keikaku-sho) for high-strength steel welds may state 'weld completion → wait 48 hours → MT/PT inspection.' This means no surface grinding or next-step work can proceed until the inspection window is complete. If you complete a weld on a Thursday evening, inspection may not happen until Saturday morning. Planning around this is a real skill in Japanese production management."

In Japan, the inspection order is controlled by the quality plan (品質計画書). 🇯🇵 TIP: When a Japanese QC engineer hands you a 品質計画書 (hinshitsu-keikaku-sho / quality plan), read it carefully. It specifies exactly which NDT method, at what stage, and by whom, for every weld joint. On major projects (bridges, buildings, ships), the quality plan is a legal document.

RT can reveal internal blowholes as round dark spots on film, and depending on geometry may also show evidence of surface pits. Both defects share the same root causes (moisture, contamination, shielding failure) but differ in WHERE the gas got trapped during solidification. 🇯🇵 TIP: Pits (ピット) on the final weld surface are an automatic VT fail in Japanese JIS tests. After completing the final pass, Japanese welders visually scan the bead surface carefully before calling the inspector — prevention means ensuring no paint, oil, rust, or moisture on the base metal before the final pass."

Confusing the two — assuming JIS certification is a legal requirement like the safety training — is a common misunderstanding among new trainees. 🇯🇵 TIP: When applying for jobs, your JIS certification card (認定証 / nintei-sho) is still the first thing employers ask for, even though it's not a legal requirement — it's an industry-standard expectation, not a law."

Work experience does not substitute for the certification scope — a 2G job legally requires Specialist Grade testing, regardless of how experienced the welder feels. 🇯🇵 TIP: Many foreign workers start with JIS Basic Grade because the flat-position test is the most approachable, but Japanese worksites quickly ask 'tate-muki dekiru?'

The code tells you exactly what test you passed. 🇯🇵 TIP: When Japanese welders introduce themselves professionally, they often state their JIS codes: 'N-2F to N-2V wo motte imasu' (N-2FとN-2Vを持っています / I hold N-2F and N-2V). This immediately communicates your capability to any Japanese supervisor. Memorize your own codes and use them confidently — it shows you understand the Japanese qualification system."

Because it is only valid 1 year and tested once annually, missing the renewal window can cost you an entire year of eligibility. Japanese building contractors keep a strict roster of AW-certified welders for each project — your AW card is checked before every critical joint assignment.

Employers who hire underwater welders typically pay relocation and living expenses, plus hazard pay. The community of qualified underwater welders in Japan is very small — once known, you will be called.

WES is for engineers who MANAGE and SUPERVISE welding, not necessarily do the welding. High salary: ¥700,000–900,000+/year. 🇯🇵 TIP: Many experienced Japanese welders who move into supervision roles pursue WES Grade 2 or Grade 1.

Managed in WPS. 🇯🇵 TIP: In Japanese pressure vessel and nuclear work, heat input limits (入熱量制限 / nyuunetsu-ryou-seigen) are written into the WPS and the welding inspector may ask 'Nyuunetsu wa WPS-nai desu ka?' (入熱はWPS内ですか？ / Is your heat input within the WPS?). Welders who track their voltage, current, and travel speed during welding — not just at the start — are the ones who consistently pass inspection.

Every qualified weld in Japanese pressure vessels, buildings, and ships must follow an approved WPS. 🇯🇵 TIP: On Japanese sites, the WPS is kept in the quality binder (品質書類 / hinshitsu-shorui) at the workstation. Before starting a critical weld, point to the WPS and confirm with your supervisor: 'Kore no WPS de yoroshii desu ka?' (これのWPSでよろしいですか？ / Is this the correct WPS to follow?).

Required for: high carbon equivalent steels (Ceq > ~0.40), thick plates, highly restrained joints. Temperature checked with ondo-chooku (温度チョーク). 🇯🇵 TIP: Japanese welders use temperature-indicating crayons (温度チョーク / ondo-chooku, also called サーモクレヨン / thermo-crayon) to verify preheat temperature before striking the arc. The crayon melts at a specific temperature — if it melts on the steel, the surface has reached that temperature. Always check BOTH sides of the joint, not just the top surface. In cold winter months on outdoor sites, preheat maintenance between passes (パス間温度管理 / pasu-kan-ondo-kanri) must also be checked regularly."

Total: ~6–7 days, ¥52,000–82,000. Now you are legally operational on virtually any Japanese job site. 🇯🇵 TIP: In Japan, safety training certificates (特別教育修了証 / tokubetsu-kyouiku-shuryo-sho) must be kept by BOTH the worker AND the employer. If a labor inspector (労働基準監督官 / rodo-kijun-kantokukan) visits the site and asks a worker to produce their certificate, the worker must have it.

Valuable for Japanese welders working on international projects (offshore, LNG, nuclear). 🇯🇵 TIP: Japan is an active member of IIW (through JWES). If you ever want to work on Japan's international LNG projects in Australia, Southeast Asia, or the Middle East, IIW certification (especially IW or IWE) signals your qualifications cross borders.

Effects: residual stress removed (↓ distortion, ↓ stress corrosion risk), hard HAZ softened (↓ cold crack risk), hydrogen released. Mandatory for boiler vessels (ボイラー), pressure equipment, and specified structural connections. 🇯🇵 TIP: PWHT in Japan is performed by specialized heat treatment companies (熱処理業者 / netsushori-gyosha) using temperature-controlled electric resistance blankets or furnaces. The entire heating and cooling cycle is recorded on a temperature chart recorder (温度記録計 / ondo-kiroku-kei) — this chart becomes a permanent quality document. As a welder, you should know the PWHT requirements before welding so you don't apply weld repairs or tack welds after the PWHT cycle — those would invalidate the treatment."

(分からない時は、すみません、質問してもいいですか？ / When I don't understand, may I ask a question?). In Japan's high-safety manufacturing culture, asking questions before starting a task is respected — making assumptions and causing a quality problem is not. Never be afraid to ask.
